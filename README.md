# AI-Recruiter-agent
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
# 🤖 AI Recruiter Agent

An AI-powered recruitment assistant that automates technical and HR interviews using **voice-based interaction**.  
Recruiters can create custom job interviews, share interview links, and get detailed candidate feedback — all without being physically present.

## ✨ Features
- 🔹 Recruiter inputs **job role, interview duration, and type of interview**
- 🔹 System automatically generates a **set of tailored questions**
- 🔹 Unique **interview link** is generated and can be shared with candidates
- 🔹 **Voice AI Agent** conducts the interview (no video, only voice)
- 🔹 Provides a **detailed feedback report** about the candidate’s performance

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend & Backend**: Next.js (React framework)

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
